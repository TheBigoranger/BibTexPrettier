# BibTexPrettier
Use Python to prettify the BibTeX file exported by Mendeley

Drag the .py file in the same pathway where your BibTeX file is. Run the python file in the cmd(or run the .bat file if you are under Windows system).

The current feature:
1. Format the title such that only the first word is capitalized.
2. Make "&" working in the reference
3. Delete the url section in the BibTex file
4. Remove \<sub\>, \</sub\>, \<i\>, \</i\>
